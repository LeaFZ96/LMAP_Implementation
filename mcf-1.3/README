1.  What's new

	see README.changes


2.  Installation & Use

	see README.msvc++ or README.gnu


4.  Documentation

    A documentation of the data structure and the interface of mcf.a is provided
    in dvi, postscript (ps), and the Adobe Portable Document Format (pdf). All
    dokuments have been created by the old DOC++ package for version 1.2. I have
    not updated it for 1.3 yet. Maybe in the future, I will use doxygen to
    generate a new documentation, but currently I have not enough free time for
    this work. 

	The program "mcf" provides help information by typing "help" or "?".


5.  Bug report

    If you have serious problems using mcf or if you have detected some bug,
    please send an email to loebel@zib.de including an short description of your
    problem as well as the minimum-cost flow instance for which the bug occurs.


6.  Publications

    Any publication reporting on results obtained using mcf must include an
    acknowledgement as well as a reference like the following: Loebel,
    A. (2004). MCF Version 1.3 - A network simplex implementation.  Available
    for academic use free of charge via WWW at www.zib.de.

<B><FONT SIZE=+4>ZIB ACADEMIC&nbsp;LICENSE</FONT></B></H1>


<P>This license for ZIB software is designed to guarantee freedom to share
and change software <B>for academic use</B>, but restricting commercial
firms from exploiting your knowhow for their benefit. The precise terms
and conditions for using, copying, distribution, and modification follow.

<H2>Terms and Conditions for Using, Copying, Distribution, and Modification</H2>

<P>The &quot;Program&quot; below refers to source, object and executable
code, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot; means either the Program
or any derivative work under copyright law: that is a work containing the
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
translated into another language. Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.
</P>

<OL>
<LI>This license applies to you only if you are a member of a noncommercial
and academic institution, e.g., a university. The license expires as soon
as you are no longer a member of this institution.</LI>

<LI>Every publication and presentation for which work based on the Program
or its output has been used must contain an appropriate citation and acknowledgement
of the author(s) of the Program.</LI>

<LI>You may copy and distribute the Program or work based on the Program
in source, object, or executable form provided that you also meet all of
the following conditions:</LI>

<P>
<OL>
<LI>You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole
or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,
to be licensed as a whole at no charge under the terms of this License.
You must accompany it with this unmodified license text.</LI>

These requirements apply to the Program or work based on the Program
as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from
the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
works in themselves, this License does not apply to those sections when
you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same
sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution
of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for
other licensees extend to the entire whole and, thus, to each and every
part regardless of who wrote it.>

<LI>You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
that you changed the files and the date of any change.</LI>

<LI>You must keep track of access to the Program (e.g., similar to the
registration procedure at ZIB).</LI>

<LI>You must accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code.</LI>

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the
source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed
(in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs,
unless that component itself accompanies the executable. 
<P>
</OL>


<LI>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except
as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program is void and will automatically
terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
copies or rights from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. </LI>

<LI>You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
it. However, nothing else grants you permission to use, modify, or distribute
the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law
if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by using, modifying or distributing
the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance
of this License to do so and all its terms and conditions for copying,
distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it. </LI>

<LI>Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor
to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipient's exercise
of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
by third parties to this License. </LI>

<LI>If, as a consequence of a court judgement or allegation of patent infringement
or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are
imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement, or otherwise) that contradict
the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions
of this License.</LI>

<LI>If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other programs
whose distribution conditions are different, write to ZIB to ask for permission.</LI>

<H2>NO WARRANTY</H2>

<LI>Because the program is licensed free of charge, there is no warranty
for the program to the extent permitted by applicable law. The copyright
holders provide the program &QUOT;as is&QUOT; without warranty of any kind,
either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied
warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The
entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you.
Should the program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary
servicing, repair, or correction. </LI>

<LI>In no event will any copyright holder, or any other party who may modify
and/or redistribute the program as permitted above, be liable to you for
damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages
arising out of the use or inability to use the program (including but not
limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained
by you or third parties or a failure of the program to operate with any
other programs), even if such holder or other party has been advised of
the possibility of such damages. </LI>
